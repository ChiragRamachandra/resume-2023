# Why did I build this website?

I mean I already had a [website](www.chiragr.com), but it was kinda old and also it had a bright theme, forget about others even when I opened I had to go and reduce the brightness of my phone/laptop.

The other problem also was when I started my old website it was meant to be a simple portfolio website, but sometime after that I thought, it would be kinda cool to have a blog of my own, and then I found a hack: [Hashnode](www.hashnode.com) has a pretty cool interface to write my blogs. But the problem was, it still looked disconnected from my primary portfolio website. I just let it be for the time being but always wanted to have a simple platform that served as a one-stop solution which did not look disconnected.

Last but not the least, I wanted to open-source my projects. Trust me, this is a very difficult thing for me to do, mostly because I am almost a self-taught programmer without a mentor (maybe the instructors on youtube and Udemy were my virtual mentor) and I am super scared to kind of put things in public where I feel people would judge me. More than that, I also wanted the entire source code to be available for anyone to use and reproduce. This particular ask made it a bit difficult to pick a tool (I mean, at this point, I mostly write on JS/TS), I had heard great things about headless cms, but that would also mean I had to put it up on some cloud provider and there still could be ambiguity about is it actually what I see is what I get, so dropped that idea, other popular tools like Hashnode, WordPress, etc also had to be discarded for similar reasons that's when I taught of using a simple markdown, I know that this might not scale, but this is purely for me and I am probably not gonna write thousands of blog in the next couple of years.

## How did I get started?

I saw this brilliant video from Sonny Sangha, on how easy it is to actually get started and build a website. I was like, you know what, if I am anyway going to make this open source, why not demonstrate how easy it is to get started in 2023? so I used this particular video as the base for my entire project.

### But this does not have anything about the blog.

Simple, I found [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-dev-to-deployment/) on Udemy by Brad Traversy, which has the entire source code also available. So voila, I mixed and matched. Used some better sliders, instead of redoing from scratch and we have the blog.

The entire source code for this project can be found in my [github](https://github.com/chiragramachandra) [Here](https://github.com/ChiragRamachandra/resume-2023).

## What next?

I plan to at least write one blog a week, I procrastinate a lot, so I am not sure if I will be able to keep up with it, but I promise to try. I also will try to use the same repo to build things, for example, I have not added any testing to the whole blog, and I want to bring that out as an article.
Will make a blog about SEO, performance, and other metrics. I mean the whole idea is to kinda show someone who is starting how easy it is to actually get better with web development in 2023.

I am also planning to branch out into mobile development and a couple of other super interesting projects this year, I'll promise to try and capture all of the above in this blog.

## Conclusion

Why is the grammar so bad? Generally, I proof-read most of the things I write, but this time I do want to keep it basic and not worry too much about grammar. Apologies, if this is something that antagonizes you, I am hoping that this exercise will also kind of help me to organize my thoughts better as I go.
